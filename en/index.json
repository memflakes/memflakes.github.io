	"content": " A Fiction from1\n 大脑是思考与行动的引擎，而且大脑是纯物理的。我们对物理定律已经有一定的了解，自然能够准确地预测人脑对周围环境的反应。因此，也能知道人类如何思考。 一进入老大哥空间站，脑部扫描仪就扫描出所有参赛者的脑部状态。我们的超级计算机皮埃尔将随时检测参赛者受到各种刺激时的反应，并且预测参赛者接下来会有什么样的行为。\n\u0026mdash; 法国数学家皮埃尔·拉普拉斯（1749～1827）的确定性论题。\n 法国科学家皮埃尔·拉普拉斯提到，如果知道物理定律和宇宙中所有粒子的位置，就能预测未来所有可能发生的事件。后来量子理论证明这种说法是错误的，因为并非所有的因果过程都完全取决于先前的条件，宇宙远比拉普拉斯想象的更不确定。\n尽管如此，量子效应只发生在最微观的层次，而世界上绝大多数物体运作的方式就像拉普拉斯想象的，所有结果仿佛都取决于之前的原因。因此，我们得以采取某种稍稍低于拉普拉斯全知观察者的姿态，并做出更加中立的预测。简言之，老大哥计算机在理论上是可行的。\n皮埃尔真的不存在吗  带着皮埃尔预测看节目，很容易让人不安。我们看到参赛者的行为一次又一次完全符合计算机的预测，而计算机只拥有人脑与环境的物理状态的信息。无论参赛者做出什么样的决定，都会被计算机提前计算出来。简单来说，参赛者似乎已不再是能做自我选择的独立能动者，反而像是机器人。\n 我们对这样的情况该如何反应？一种是直接否认这种现象的可能性。人来拥有自由意志，这意味着没有任何一部计算机能作出我们想象中的皮埃尔做的事。然而，这样的反应只是单方面拒绝了我们不喜欢的事物。我们需要知道为什么皮埃尔是不可能存在的，而不是只在口头上否认。\n以量子不确定性作为反对理由并不可行。即使量子理论确实引入了比我们的思想实验更多的不可预测性，也只会以不可预测且随机的元素取代完全可预测的因果流程。但这样一来，我们的行动将取决于随机而非严密的因果，因而完全失去自主性。自由意志的展现在于我们能脱离物理因果链，但是在量子理论之下，我们似乎无法做到这一点。\n皮埃尔的存在会威胁自由意志吗 另一种反应是接受皮埃尔可能真实存在，但是在某些重要层面上依然认为自由意志并未受到皮埃尔的威胁。一种可能是区别可预测性与自由这两个概念。举例来说，我们通常能预测朋友会点什么餐点或饮料，但我们不会因此认为他们不能自由选择。如果这是对的，那我们又何必因为能完全预测一个人的行为就认定人不自由呢？\n不过这种说法真的能拯救自由意志吗？在选择的时候，若能不理会发生的一切，坚决作出自己的选择，如果这样的能力不能称为自由，那什么是自由呢？\n 一头想要被吃掉的猪， 第9章。 ↩   "

Donoghue, Department of Neuroscience, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.\nCortical map plasticity （大脑皮层组织的可塑性）\nIt is now well established that the functional organization of the cerebral cortex is plastic, that is, changes in organization occur throughout life in response to normal as well as abnormal experience. The potential for reorganization has been demonstrated in both sensory and motor areas of adult cortex, either as a consequence of trauma (创伤), pathological （病理学） changes, manipulation of sensory experience, or learning. These changes can only be evaluated with reference to an extensive epxerimental base that has identified a repeatable representation pattern (e.g. somatotopy, tonotopy, or retinotopy), for which change can be detected. While the scope of changes are often at the edge of our technical capabilities to assess, there are striking examples of significant and rapid change (for reviews, see Sanes \u0026amp; Donoghue, 2000; Buonomano \u0026amp; Merzenich, 1998). There is an overwhelming belief that modifications in cortical organization emerge through changes in synaptic efficacy within the cortex and elsewhere in the nervous system. Further, these changes are have been closely linked to the phenomena called long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). This review deals mainly with the changes that have been detected in the motor cortex and their link to synaptic modifications. Some of the most convincing evidence that learning and practice influence cortical organization and that learning operates through LTP/D-mediated mechanisms has come through work in the motor cortex. This work is also of profound significance to the medical community because it implies that the impaired or damaged motor cortex can be restructured through appropriate physical rehabilitation schemes or through pharmacological means that alter mechanisms accounting for LTP/D.\n"

It is still a challenge to study plasticity directly in the human nervous system. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), however, has become a suitable non-invasive and painless technique, which can be applied to detect changes in cortical excitability or connectivity as indicators of plasticity. Further, TMS can be used to induce short-lasting virtual lesions in order to test the functional relevance of brain plasticity. Finally, TMS can induce plasticity itself. In this book, we utilize TMS in these ways to investigate and manipulate plasticity in the human nervous system. In so doing, we have been fortunate to gather many of the world\u0026rsquo;s leading contributors in this field.\n大脑的可塑性在神经科学的诸多研究领域中的重要性正在不断增加，这些包括神经的发展，学习，以及修复等神经科学。然而，直接在人类神经系统中研究其可塑性还是困难重重。然而，经颅电磁刺激（TMS），作为一个无创伤、无疼痛的技术，很适合用于研究大脑可塑性。因为这种技术可以检测大脑皮层的兴奋性以及连接程度，而这些都是大脑可塑性的重要指标。此外，经颅电磁刺激可以在大脑中诱导产生暂时性的损伤，以用于测试大脑可塑性的功能关联特性。最后，经颅电磁刺激可以诱导大脑产生可塑性。在本书中，我们利用经颅电磁刺激来研究和控制大脑神经系统的可塑性。在这个过程中，我们有幸的聚集了世界各地的在该领域有突出贡献的研究者来共同完成此书。\n Plasticity in the human nervous system: investigations with transcranial magnetic stimulation. ↩   "

	"content": " He who does not show himself is seen everywhere; He who does not assert himself is well-known; He who does not boast wins success; He who is not proud can lead; As he contends for nothing, none in the world could contend with him. From Laws Divine and Human1, translation version by Yuanchong Xu2:\nDivine law is not the common law  The divine law may be spoken of, but it is not the common law.\n By common law Lao Zi means those enforced by human beings. So we may see the difference between divine and human laws.\nThe divine law is objective truth which does not depend on human will for its existence, while human laws do. The former may be called natural philosophy, while the latter social philosophy. The former will not change when the latter does. That is the reason why Lao Zi says that the divine law is not the common law.\nNon-interference The divine law will not interfere. Only when the law does not interfere can all things develop freely. So the law should always be inactive so as to let all things be active.\nThe activity of all things is the result of the law\u0026rsquo;s inaction or non-interference. The law\u0026rsquo;s inaction provides the condition for the activity of all things. When we say there is nothing the law cannot do, we mean that the activity of all things are the embodiment of the divine law. \u0026ldquo;Therefore the sage does everything without interference, teaches everyone without persuasion, and lets everything begin uninitiated and grow unpossessed. Everything is done without being his deed, and succeeds without being his success.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Therefore the sage says, \u0026lsquo;if I do nothing wrong, the people will go the right way\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThus we see \u0026ldquo;to rule by inaction or non-interference\u0026rdquo; is an important priciple of the Old Master\u0026rsquo;s political philosophy.\nNon-contention As a result of inaction, the Old Master advocates non-contention. In Chapter 8 he says, \u0026ldquo;The highest good (virtue) is like water. Water benefits everything by giving without taking or contending. It likes the low place others dislike, so it follows closely the divine law.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He who does not shown himself is seen everywhere. He who does not assert himself is well-known. He who does not boast wins success. He who is not proud can lead. As he contends for nothing, none in the world could contend with him.\u0026rdquo;\nDesire control How can the principle of non-contention be carried out?\n\u0026ldquo;Be simple and plain, selfless and desireless\u0026rdquo;: If you can control or subdue your desire, of course you will not contend for personal profit. That is the reason why the Old Master says in Chapter 1, \u0026ldquo;So we should be free from desires in order to understand the internal mystery of the divine law, and we should have desires in order to observe the external manifestaions.\u0026rdquo; Only when you understand the divine law inwardly and outwardly can you be selfless and desireless.\nContentment How can we control or subdue our desire?\nThe Old Master puts forward his principle of contentment in Chapter 13: : It needs observation to know others but reflection to know onself. Physically strong, one can conquer others; mentally strong, one can conquer oneself. Content, one is rich.\u0026rdquo;\nThat is to say, if you know yourself through reflection, you will become mentally strong and conquer yourself. Content, you can control your desire.\nIn Capther 46, he further says, \u0026ldquo;No crime is greater than insatiable desire, no woe is greater than covetise. If you know contentment comes from being content, you will always have enough.\u0026rdquo; That is to say, if you are mentally content, then you will have enough material.\nNon-interference, non-contention, desire-control and contentment are the four important principles of the Old Master\u0026rsquo;s philosophy.\n Relativism \u0026ldquo;For \u0026lsquo;to be\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;not to be\u0026rsquo; coexist, without \u0026lsquo;difficult\u0026rsquo;, there cannot be \u0026lsquo;easy\u0026rsquo;; without \u0026lsquo;long\u0026rsquo; there cannot be \u0026lsquo;short\u0026rsquo;. The contrary completement each other\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;Stooping, you will be preserved;\nWronged, you will be righted;\nHollow, you will be filled;\nWorn out, you will be renewed;\nHaving little, you may gain;\nHaving much, you may be at a loss.\u0026rdquo;\n Laws Divine and Human, Lai Zi, China Ancient Literature, 500BC. ↩ Laws Divine and Human, Xu Yuanchong, Zhonghua Book Company, 2012. ↩   "

They say that the area lacks a meaningful framework through which they can relate the various models, theories and opinions being expressed within it; and it lacks \u0026lsquo;roots\u0026rsquo; in the way that evolutionary theory gives \u0026lsquo;history\u0026rsquo;, coherence and grounding to all of biology. It is a truism spoken by many that if we want to truly understand functions of living things \u0026ndash; including mental systems \u0026ndash; then we really need to be clear about why they evolved. Sadly, recent attempts to incorporate psychology within the classical evolutionary framework, far from yielding fresh insights, seem to have generated even more division and controversy. In consequence, there are still crucial gaps in our understanding of human minds and human nature, and about their continuity with the rest of life. This creates many problems for scientists, and increasing public scepticism about scientific accounts of what we\u0026rsquo;ve actually got in our heads and how it works. The main reason for the gaps, I think, is the difficulty in envisaging and describing the conditions under which something as brilliant, and seemingly transcendental, as the human mind could have arisen from far simpler material beginnings. To many people it seems to have required something like a miracle, or the hand of an intelligent designer: what else could account for the amazing complexity of human minds and the gulf between it and all other living forms? Fortunately, that difficulty is now easing as new methodological and theoretical advances \u0026ndash; especially in the realm of dynamic systems \u0026ndash; begin to make a coherent picture of \u0026lsquo;mind from matter\u0026rsquo; more feasible. It requires new concepts, from a wide range of disciplines, and new ways of thinking about the world, but the picture is transforming our views of science and evolution, as well as the nature and origins of mind. This book aims to bring those new concepts together, hopefully in a style accessible to most general readers, as well as serious students, and with widespread implications for our views of the origins and nature of mind. This is, of course, and a difficult trail to follow: a convincing story calls for more than mere description of a sequence of forms(a kind of \u0026lsquo;tree of intelligence\u0026rsquo; to parallel Darwin\u0026rsquo;s tree of life). It also requires an underlying \u0026lsquo;plot\u0026rsquo;, a causal rationale, or a description of the evolutionary \u0026lsquo;laws of motion\u0026rsquo; wringing such a remarkable sequence from ordinary natural materials and forces. The realisation that the world is not the stable, orderly place that dogma once deemed it to be, but one of the continual interaction and change \u0026ndash; a very dynamic place \u0026ndash; has also created new concepts of the complexity and structure of the world, and indeed, the great beauty, that lies within. These ideas have brought new focus on environmental change and on the evolution of intelligent systems for dealing with it. So the story, here, traces intelligent systems from the origins of life in molecular ensembles, through succeeding levels of complexity in cells, brains and cognitive systems, to finally demystify the origins and nature of the human mind itself.\n Content  Why So Complex?

	"content": " Book: Love \u0026amp; Math, The Heart of Hidden Reality, by Edward Frenkel, Basic Books, A member of the perseus books group, New York.\nAbout the author \u0026ldquo;when you are in love, who can stop you\u0026rdquo; Growing up in the former Soviet Union. Not admitted by Moscow State University. Sneaked to attend lectures and seminars. Read books by his own.\nCollege student, pushing the boundaries of the unknown. At age 21, invited to Harvard University as a Visiting Professor. Then a Harvard Professor without a Ph.D.\nLanglands Program in last twenty years.\n What if you had to take an art class in which you were only taught how to paint a fence? What if you were never shown the paintings of van Gogh and Picasso, weren\u0026rsquo;t even told they existed? Alas, this is how math is taught, and so for most of us it becomes the intellectual equivalent of watching paint dry\u0026hellip; While the paintings of the great masters are readily available, the math of the great masters is locked away.\n \n In this heartfelt and passionate book, Frenkel shows that matchematics \u0026ndash; far from occupying a specialist niche \u0026ndash; goes to the heart of all matter, uniting us across cultures, time, and space.\n \n \u0026hellip; most people are dunted by math. It has become, in the words of poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger, \u0026ldquo; a blind spot in our culture \u0026ndash; alien territory, in which only the elite, the initiated few have managed to entrench themselves\u0026rdquo;. It is rare, he says, that we \u0026ldquo; encounter a person who asserts vehemently that the mere thought of reading a novel, or looking at a picture, or seeing a movie causes hime insufferable torment\u0026rdquo;, but \u0026ldquo;sensible, educated people\u0026rdquo; often say \u0026ldquo;with a remarkable blend of defiance and pride\u0026rdquo; that match is \u0026ldquo;pure torture\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;nightmare\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;turns them off\u0026rdquo;.\n \n \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;The laws of Nature are written in the language of matchematics.\u0026rdquo; Math is a way to describe reality and figure out how the world works, a universal language that has become the gold standard of truth. In our world increasingly driven by science and technology, matchematics is becoming, ever more, the source of power, welath, and progress. Hence those who are fluent in this new language will be on the cutting edge of progress.\n \n"

	"content": " He who does not show himself is seen everywhere; He who does not assert himself is well-known; He who does not boast wins success; He who is not proud can lead; As he contends for nothing, none in the world could contend with him. From Laws Divine and Human1, translation version by Yuanchong Xu2:\nDivine law is not the common law  The divine law may be spoken of, but it is not the common law.\n By common law Lao Zi means those enforced by human beings. So we may see the difference between divine and human laws.\nThe divine law is objective truth which does not depend on human will for its existence, while human laws do. The former may be called natural philosophy, while the latter social philosophy. The former will not change when the latter does. That is the reason why Lao Zi says that the divine law is not the common law.\nNon-interference The divine law will not interfere. Only when the law does not interfere can all things develop freely. So the law should always be inactive so as to let all things be active.\nThe activity of all things is the result of the law\u0026rsquo;s inaction or non-interference. The law\u0026rsquo;s inaction provides the condition for the activity of all things. When we say there is nothing the law cannot do, we mean that the activity of all things are the embodiment of the divine law. \u0026ldquo;Therefore the sage does everything without interference, teaches everyone without persuasion, and lets everything begin uninitiated and grow unpossessed. Everything is done without being his deed, and succeeds without being his success.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Therefore the sage says, \u0026lsquo;if I do nothing wrong, the people will go the right way\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThus we see \u0026ldquo;to rule by inaction or non-interference\u0026rdquo; is an important priciple of the Old Master\u0026rsquo;s political philosophy.\nNon-contention As a result of inaction, the Old Master advocates non-contention. In Chapter 8 he says, \u0026ldquo;The highest good (virtue) is like water. Water benefits everything by giving without taking or contending. It likes the low place others dislike, so it follows closely the divine law.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He who does not shown himself is seen everywhere. He who does not assert himself is well-known. He who does not boast wins success. He who is not proud can lead. As he contends for nothing, none in the world could contend with him.\u0026rdquo;\nDesire control How can the principle of non-contention be carried out?\n\u0026ldquo;Be simple and plain, selfless and desireless\u0026rdquo;: If you can control or subdue your desire, of course you will not contend for personal profit. That is the reason why the Old Master says in Chapter 1, \u0026ldquo;So we should be free from desires in order to understand the internal mystery of the divine law, and we should have desires in order to observe the external manifestaions.\u0026rdquo; Only when you understand the divine law inwardly and outwardly can you be selfless and desireless.\nContentment How can we control or subdue our desire?\nThe Old Master puts forward his principle of contentment in Chapter 13: : It needs observation to know others but reflection to know onself. Physically strong, one can conquer others; mentally strong, one can conquer oneself. Content, one is rich.\u0026rdquo;\nThat is to say, if you know yourself through reflection, you will become mentally strong and conquer yourself. Content, you can control your desire.\nIn Capther 46, he further says, \u0026ldquo;No crime is greater than insatiable desire, no woe is greater than covetise. If you know contentment comes from being content, you will always have enough.\u0026rdquo; That is to say, if you are mentally content, then you will have enough material.\nNon-interference, non-contention, desire-control and contentment are the four important principles of the Old Master\u0026rsquo;s philosophy.\n Relativism \u0026ldquo;For \u0026lsquo;to be\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;not to be\u0026rsquo; coexist, without \u0026lsquo;difficult\u0026rsquo;, there cannot be \u0026lsquo;easy\u0026rsquo;; without \u0026lsquo;long\u0026rsquo; there cannot be \u0026lsquo;short\u0026rsquo;. The contrary completement each other\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;Stooping, you will be preserved;\nWronged, you will be righted;\nHollow, you will be filled;\nWorn out, you will be renewed;\nHaving little, you may gain;\nHaving much, you may be at a loss.\u0026rdquo;\n Laws Divine and Human, Lai Zi, China Ancient Literature, 500BC. ↩ Laws Divine and Human, Xu Yuanchong, Zhonghua Book Company, 2012. ↩   "

	"content": " Book: The Evolution of Intelligent Systems \u0026ndash; How Molecules Became Minds, by Ken Richardson, 2010, Palgrave Macmillan\nPreface  Many people interested in the nature and origins of the human mind complain about the lack of coherence and depth in existing scientific accounts. They say that the area lacks a meaningful framework through which they can relate the various models, theories and opinions being expressed within it; and it lacks \u0026lsquo;roots\u0026rsquo; in the way that evolutionary theory gives \u0026lsquo;history\u0026rsquo;, coherence and grounding to all of biology. It is a truism spoken by many that if we want to truly understand functions of living things \u0026ndash; including mental systems \u0026ndash; then we really need to be clear about why they evolved. Sadly, recent attempts to incorporate psychology within the classical evolutionary framework, far from yielding fresh insights, seem to have generated even more division and controversy. In consequence, there are still crucial gaps in our understanding of human minds and human nature, and about their continuity with the rest of life. This creates many problems for scientists, and increasing public scepticism about scientific accounts of what we\u0026rsquo;ve actually got in our heads and how it works. The main reason for the gaps, I think, is the difficulty in envisaging and describing the conditions under which something as brilliant, and seemingly transcendental, as the human mind could have arisen from far simpler material beginnings. To many people it seems to have required something like a miracle, or the hand of an intelligent designer: what else could account for the amazing complexity of human minds and the gulf between it and all other living forms? Fortunately, that difficulty is now easing as new methodological and theoretical advances \u0026ndash; especially in the realm of dynamic systems \u0026ndash; begin to make a coherent picture of \u0026lsquo;mind from matter\u0026rsquo; more feasible. It requires new concepts, from a wide range of disciplines, and new ways of thinking about the world, but the picture is transforming our views of science and evolution, as well as the nature and origins of mind. This book aims to bring those new concepts together, hopefully in a style accessible to most general readers, as well as serious students, and with widespread implications for our views of the origins and nature of mind. This is, of course, and a difficult trail to follow: a convincing story calls for more than mere description of a sequence of forms(a kind of \u0026lsquo;tree of intelligence\u0026rsquo; to parallel Darwin\u0026rsquo;s tree of life). It also requires an underlying \u0026lsquo;plot\u0026rsquo;, a causal rationale, or a description of the evolutionary \u0026lsquo;laws of motion\u0026rsquo; wringing such a remarkable sequence from ordinary natural materials and forces. The realisation that the world is not the stable, orderly place that dogma once deemed it to be, but one of the continual interaction and change \u0026ndash; a very dynamic place \u0026ndash; has also created new concepts of the complexity and structure of the world, and indeed, the great beauty, that lies within. These ideas have brought new focus on environmental change and on the evolution of intelligent systems for dealing with it. So the story, here, traces intelligent systems from the origins of life in molecular ensembles, through succeeding levels of complexity in cells, brains and cognitive systems, to finally demystify the origins and nature of the human mind itself.\n Content  Why So Complex?

Then a Harvard Professor without a Ph.D.\nLanglands Program in last twenty years.\n What if you had to take an art class in which you were only taught how to paint a fence? What if you were never shown the paintings of van Gogh and Picasso, weren\u0026rsquo;t even told they existed? Alas, this is how math is taught, and so for most of us it becomes the intellectual equivalent of watching paint dry\u0026hellip; While the paintings of the great masters are readily available, the math of the great masters is locked away.\n \n In this heartfelt and passionate book, Frenkel shows that matchematics \u0026ndash; far from occupying a specialist niche \u0026ndash; goes to the heart of all matter, uniting us across cultures, time, and space.\n \n \u0026hellip; most people are dunted by math. It has become, in the words of poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger, \u0026ldquo; a blind spot in our culture \u0026ndash; alien territory, in which only the elite, the initiated few have managed to entrench themselves\u0026rdquo;. It is rare, he says, that we \u0026ldquo; encounter a person who asserts vehemently that the mere thought of reading a novel, or looking at a picture, or seeing a movie causes hime insufferable torment\u0026rdquo;, but \u0026ldquo;sensible, educated people\u0026rdquo; often say \u0026ldquo;with a remarkable blend of defiance and pride\u0026rdquo; that match is \u0026ldquo;pure torture\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;nightmare\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;turns them off\u0026rdquo;.\n \n \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;The laws of Nature are written in the language of matchematics.\u0026rdquo; Math is a way to describe reality and figure out how the world works, a universal language that has become the gold standard of truth. In our world increasingly driven by science and technology, matchematics is becoming, ever more, the source of power, welath, and progress. Hence those who are fluent in this new language will be on the cutting edge of progress.\n \n"
